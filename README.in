The container image running
`[gitlab-runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner)`
based on [Debian Stretch](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStretch)
[image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkovac/runit-stretch/).

Main reason for basing it on top of Debian is that I need to test lot of
applications using standard Debian packages and I can use it as a simple
shared executor for many projects in my own controlled environment.

This runner supports running sister-docker containers and thus the docker
executor, as well as shell executor.
